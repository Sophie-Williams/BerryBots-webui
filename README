This is a simple web app that lets you play BerryBots through a browser. It
provides a UI to write Lua code and configure a BerryBots match. On submit, a
Perl script saves your code, runs the BerryBots match (headless) on a server,
saves the replay, and loads the replay in your browser.

You can try it on the web at: http://playberrybots.com

To set this up yourself, you'd need to:
  * Copy the webui files (this project) to your web server, eg /var/www/bbui.
  * Compile BerryBots 'webui' Makefile target from source on your server.
      unzip ~/Downloads/berrybots_src_1.3.2.zip
      cd berrybots
      ./configure --with-nodeps
      make webui
  * Update cgi-bin/runmatch.pl to point at your BerryBots instance.
  * Modify permissions to ensure your web server can execute BerryBots, that the
    web 'replays' directory is writeable, and that the files in cgi-bin are
    executable.
